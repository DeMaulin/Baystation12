changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added communications functionality to AI holopads. To use, stand on a holopad and click it. Make a new holocall and select the target pad from the list. The targetpad will light up, emit a sound and inform nearby players about the incoming call. To pick it up, just click the pad. The caller is projected above the holopad and can talk to/emote with all people in view of the holopad. To end the call, step off the holopad. The call can also be ended from the other side by clicking the active holopad."
